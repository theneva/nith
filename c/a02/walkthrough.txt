This is a simple walkthrough for the game.

I didn't implement any kind of combined events aside from having to get your body temperature and awakeness high enough before going outside via the living room. I believe I prove that I know how to play around with memory with the code base as it is, so adding more functionality seems unnecessary. I would probably implement a kind of prerequisite item in the Item struct, and only display the item as an option if the room did not have the prerequisite item anymore.

In order to win, you need to get your awakeness and body temperature to at least 100 %. With this implementation, the only way to win is if you end up with 101 % of each, which can only be achieved through using every item except for the TV, which does nothing.

Please don't type in anything except numbers as the option selection isn't validated.

How to win:
PREREQUISITE) Have Wine installed and/or run the game with "path/to/game force"
0) You start out in the bedroom. Put the clothes on.
1) Head over to the wardrobe and put the scarf on. Go back to the bedroom.
2) Go to the bathroom.
3) Take the Aspirin.
4) Take a shower.
5) Move to the living room.
6) Move to the kitchen.
7) Drink the coffee.
8) Go back to the living room.
9) Go outside.

Yay.
